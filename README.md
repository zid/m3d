# M3D

TGM3 loads the frame borders from a file ending in .m3d

I was unable to find any information on this format by googling for things like _root_ or MT TX etc found within the file,
so I have reverse engineered it instead.

Only supports the single instance of m3d I am aware of (frame01.m3d, the rest are just clones with different textures).

If anyone knows any other games using this format let me know.
